# Horiseon-Challenge

## Description

This project assists Horiseon Marketing Agency achieve accessibility standards and increase the site's own search engine optimization.
The motivation for this project was the privilege of creating quality work that also allows access to persons with disabilities, particularly those with any vision impediments that may rely on a reader device to access available resources on the web.
Beside providing the client with a website that now included alt text to meet accessibility standards, I was able to provide the client with a cleaner code that now includes semantic elements and consolidated CSS. 

Many challenges were faced during this process given the beginner level of my experience. However, I was able to further expand my critical thinking skills and hone in on my attention to detail in order to clean up the code as needed. I am certain I have much more to learn, but keeping a learner mentality will help with my success.
